# 8086-8088 Microprocessor Simulator GUI

## Description

The 8086/8088 Microprocessor Simulator GUI is a coding project that provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for simulating the behavior of the 8086/8088 microprocessor. This simulator allows users to input commands and observe the flow of instructions as they are executed by the virtual processor. The GUI displays the movement of data between various components, such as the Program Counter (PC), processor, memory, and registers.

## Features

- Interactive GUI for inputting commands and viewing simulation results.
- Real-time visualization of instruction execution flow.
- Dynamic updates to memory and register values during execution.
- Support for common 8086/8088 instructions and addressing modes.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/mujipro1/8086-8088-Simulator.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:

  ```sh
     cd 8086-microprocessor-simulator
  ```
3. Install the required dependencies. This project relies on the tkinter library for the GUI.
   If you're using a virtual environment, make sure it's activated before installing the dependencies:
   ```sh
      _pip install tkinter_
   ```
## Usage

1. Run the `main.py` script
2. GUI will launch, enter the 8086/8088 Instructions and click on `Next` Button
3. Keep on pressing the `Next` Button until the instruction completes execution.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you'd like to enhance the simulator's functionality or fix any issues,
feel free to submit a pull request. Please follow the existing code style and provide clear commit messages.
